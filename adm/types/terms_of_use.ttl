This policy applies only to content in the Public Domain, additional restrictions can apply to Public Domain content, see Restricted Content Policy.

Public domain means, the work has been identified as being free of known restrictions under copyright law, including all related and neighboring rights. You can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission.  See https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/
BDRC’s Public Domain Mark enables works that are no longer restricted by copyright to be marked as such in a standard and simple way, making them easily discoverable and available to others. Many cultural heritage institutions including museums, libraries and other curators are knowledgeable about the copyright status of paintings, books and manuscripts, photographs and other works in their collections, many of which are old and no longer under copyright.  The Public Domain Mark operates as a tag or a label, allowing institutions like those as well as others with such knowledge to communicate that a work is no longer restricted by copyright and can be freely used by others.  The mark can also be an important source of information, allowing others to verify a work’s copyright status and learn more about the work.

Although BDRC does not impose any legally binding conditions on access to the Public Domain content, BDRC requests that it is given attribution as a source of the content, to the extent it is technologically feasible to do so.

Definitions are available in BDRC’s ontology service: http://purl.bdrc.io/resource/LicensePublicDomain 

Copyright Policy
BDRC applies section 108 copyright analyses to its works.

BDRC indicates the copyright status of a book in its Metadata. This status is purely informational and BDRC cannot be held liable of its accuracy.

BDRC considers reproductions (digital images, textual reproductions produced from OCR and manual input) to have the same copyright as the original work.
Some of the content available through BDRC may be governed by local, national, and/or international laws and regulations, and your use of such content is solely at your own risk. You agree to abide by all applicable laws and regulations, including intellectual property laws, in connection with your use of BDRC.

Definitions are available in BDRC’s ontology service: http://purl.bdrc.io/resource/LicenseAllRightsReserved 

Restricted Access Policy
For content marked as restricted by tradition, you agree to access only content that you have been authorized to access by a lineage holder, and for which you understand the restrictions. You agree to fully respect the conditions under which you have been provided access to the material.

For content marked as restricted in a particular country, you agree not to transfer the material by any mean (paper, electronic) to this country.

For content marked as restricted to scholarly use, you agree not to have.

In addition to other applying restrictions, you agree to share the material solely under the agreement to respect these restrictions.

In addition to licensing, BDRC assigns access designations to works published on its online library at tbrc.org based on cultural commitments to stakeholders. The following access designations are used:
● Restricted Sealed (tib: rgya can) – Some works of the types listed below are restricted because of the nature of their content. The owners of the traditions request these restrictions. Note that if these works appear in the collected works (tib: gsung ‘bum) of the author, they are not restricted as they appear in context.
○ Sealed Texts (tib: bka' rgya ma)
○ Esoteric Collections (tib: be'u 'bum and sngags 'bum)
○ Secret Practice or Oral Instruction (tib: mkhyud dpyad)
○ Tantric Sexual Practice (tib: thabs lam)
○ Secret Sealed (tib: gsang ba rgya can)
○ Secret Biographies (tib: gsang ba'i rnam thar)
○ Ear-Whispered Lineage (tib: snyan brgyud)
○ Esoteric Instructions (tib: khrid yig)
● Temporarily Restricted – works marked as temporarily restricted, until at some time BDRC is instructed to release the restriction. Unless otherwise specified, the time duration is 3 years from the date of publication.
● Restricted by Quality – works marked restricted by quality in cases where the scanned source is of poor quality or incomplete. BDRC reserves the right to restrict access to these works and may direct users to a better quality edition.
● Restricted by BDRC – works marked generally as restricted by BDRC for whatever purpose BDRC deems necessary.
● Restricted in China – works marked restricted where heightened sensitivity in China precludes access in China. Note: these works will be available on our website outside of China.

Specific definitions are available in BDRC’s ontology service: http://purl.bdrc.io/ontology/admin/AccessType 

CC0 Policy
BDRC makes its set of metadata available for public use under the CC0 1.0 Public Domain Designation.

CC0 enables scientists, educators, artists and other creators and owners of copyright- or database-protected content to waive those interests in their works and thereby place them as completely as possible in the public domain, so that others may freely build upon, enhance and reuse the works for any purposes without restriction under copyright or database law.

In contrast to CC’s licenses that allow copyright holders to choose from a range of permissions while retaining their copyright, CC0 empowers yet another choice altogether – the choice to opt out of copyright and database protection, and the exclusive rights automatically granted to creators – the “no rights reserved” alternative to our licenses.

Although BDRC does not impose any legally binding conditions on access to the 
Metadata, BDRC requests that you act in accordance with the following Community 

Norms of BDRC with respect to the Metadata:

First, BDRC requests that it is given attribution as a source of the Metadata, to the extent it is technologically feasible to do so.

Second, BDRC requests that you make the Metadata and any improvements thereto freely available on the same terms as BDRC has done, i.e., without claiming any legal right in, or imposing any legally binding conditions on access to, the Metadata or your improvements, and with a request to act in accordance with these Community Norms.
As a database in the sense of EU Protection of Databases, it is also provided under CC0 license. Extractions of the database of BDRC are considered to be under the same license as the database itself.

Specific definition is available in BDRC’s ontology service: http://purl.bdrc.io/resource/LicenseCC0

This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable.

2.

Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to you.\">Terms of Use

Buddhist Digital Resource Center believes strongly in unfettered access to the riches of Buddhist cultural heritage. To enable and enhance this access, we have adopted standardized rights vocabulary developed at Harvard University (http://library.harvard.edu/open-metadata) and RightsStatements.org. Additional access policies defined herein are born out of BDRC’s commitment to stakeholders and are intended to (1) maximize access of Buddhist works to sustain living traditions and (2) protect the legal and cultural rights of Buddhist authors and publishers.  As a public charity, BDRC’s mission is to make the results of its work widely available. BDRC requests that our users, where appropriate, attribute BDRC. The purpose of this Terms of Use is to orient the user on the use of the three central domains of BDRC’s archive: textual resources, metadata and source code.

The latest version of the Terms of Use can be found at:

http://purl.bdrc.io/resource/TermsOfUseBDRCGeneral

Text Resources
BDRC indicates two license types to text resources with several possible access restrictions.  For works whose rights have expired, BDRC uses Public Domain (see Public Domain Policy below). For copyright works, BDRC applies section 108 copyright analyses to its works (see Copyright Policy below). Finally, BDRC applies access restrictions to works based on cultural commitments to authors (see Restricted Access Policy below).

Metadata
In order to facilitate use and reuse in machine environments, BDRC makes its metadata available for public use under the CC0 1.0 Public Domain Designation. See CC0 Policy below for more details.  We ask that machine harvesting attribute BDRC wherever possible.  License definitions are available in BDRC’s ontology service: http://purl.bdrc.io/ontology/admin/License 

Source Code
BDRC releases all the source code it produces under free licenses. The licenses vary according to the different software communities, the Apache 2.0 and MIT License are the most used. See BDRC’s code repository for specific licenses used.
